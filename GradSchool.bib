	abstract = {Analysis of habitat use based on radioâtagged animals presents difficulties inadequately addressed by current methods. Areas of concern are sampling level, data pooling across individuals, nonâindependence of habitat proportions, differential habitat use by groups of animals, and arbitrary definition of habitat availability. We advocate proportional habitat use by individual animals as a basis for analysis. Hypothesis testing of such nonstandard multivariate data is done by compositional analysis, which encompasses all {MANOVA/MANCOVAâtype} linear models. The applications to habitat use range from testing for age class effects or seasonal differences, to examining relationships with food abundance or home range size. We take as an example the comparison of habitat use and availability. The concepts are explained and demonstrated on two data sets, illustrating different methods of treating missing values. We compare utilized with available habitats in two stages, examining home range selection within the overall study area first, then habitat use within the home range. At each stage, assuming that use differs from random, habitats can be ranked according to relative use, and significant betweenârank differences located. Compositional analysis is also suited to the analysis of time budgets or diets.},

	abstract = {Urban development is shown to induce predictable changes in satellite-based measures of radiant surface temperature and evapotranspiration fraction–as long as certain features of the development are known. Specifically, the vegetation changes that accompany the development and the initial climatic state of the land parcel must be noted. Techniques are also developed for quantifying the effects of urbanization on the surface hydrology at a watershed scale. Streamflow and precipitation data are related graphically in order to determine a watershed's general ratio of stormwater runoff to rainfall, along with any changes in the ratio over time. Four distinct runoff responses, separated by season and antecedent moisture conditions, are distinguishable for a particular basin, with the response during the non-summer months under typical antecedent moisture conditions the most representative of and responsive to land-use patterns. This particular runoff response can be estimated from satellite-derived land cover patterns and certain physical attributes of a basin. These satellite-based microclimate and hydrologic analyses are coupled with an existing urban growth model ({SLEUTH).} The {SLEUTH} urban growth model simulates future development scenarios for a region of interest. The resulting changes in urban land use lead to the evolution of site-specific climate and hydrology based on the scheme that is presented in this paper. This study, as well as related tools and bodies of knowledge, can be used to broaden the scientific basis behind land-use management decisions.},

	abstract = {The rapidly increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases may lead to significant changes in regional and seasonal climate patterns. Such changes can strongly influence the diversity and distribution of species and, therefore, affect ecosystems and biodiversity. To assess these changes we developed a model, called {EUROMOVE.} The model uses climate data from 1990 to 2050 as compiled from the {IMAGE} 2 model, and determines climate envelopes for about 1400 plant species by multiple logistic regression analysis. The climate envelopes were applied to the projected climate to obtain predictions about plant diversity and distributions by 2050. For each European grid cell, {EUROMOVE} calculates which species would still occur in forecasted future climate conditions and which not. The results show major changes in biodiversity by 2050. On average, 32\% of the European plant species that were present in a cell in 1990 would disappear from that cell. The area, in which 32\% or more of the 1990 species will disappear, takes up 44\% of the modelled European area. Individual responses of the plant species to the forecasted climate change were diverse. In reviewing possible future trends, we found that plant species, in general, would find their current climate envelopes further northeast by 2050, shifting ranges that were comparable with those ranges in other studies.},

Some claim that stakeholders make inadequate use of scientific information and analysis and are all too ready to sacrifice technical quality for political expediency. This article looks to the case study record to examine the quality of the decisions from stakeholder-based processes. The data for the analysis come from a "case survey," in which researchers coded information from 239 published case studies of stakeholder involvement in environmental decision making. These cases reflect a diversity of planning, management, and implementation activities carried out by environmental and natural resource agencies at many levels of government. Overall, the case-study record suggests that there should be little concern that stakeholder processes are resulting in low-quality decisions. The majority of cases contain evidence of stakeholders improving decisions over the status quo; adding new information, ideas, and analysis; and having adequate access to technical and scientific resources. Indeed, data suggest that it is the more intensive stakeholder processes–precisely those that have aroused recent concern–that are more likely to result in higher-quality decisions.},

The geologically parameterized model for this study provides a good fit to measured hydraulic heads in the watershed and offers a method to estimate spatially and temporally variable solute fluxes via ground water to streams and lakes. The results demonstrate that there is a considerable legacy of land use influencing surface water quality at the study site. The simulated chloride concentrations produced with salted roads as the only chloride source are similar to measured surface water chloride concentrations throughout most of the watershed, except in regions where other sources for chloride (e.g., high-density septic systems, locations of oil brine fields) likely exist, Impacts of other land use related solutes on baseflow surface water quality could also be explored using this approach. As a result, watershed managers could be provided with quantitative information about the potential impacts of developments and associated surface-applied solutes on future surface water quality.},

	abstract = {The dynamic spatial redistribution of individuals is a key driving force of various spatiotemporal phenomena on geographical scales. It can synchronize populations of interacting species, stabilize them, and diversify gene pools(1-3). Human travel, for example, is responsible for the geographical spread of human infectious disease(4-9). In the light of increasing international trade, intensified human mobility and the imminent threat of an influenza A epidemic(10), the knowledge of dynamical and statistical properties of human travel is of fundamental importance. Despite its crucial role, a quantitative assessment of these properties on geographical scales remains elusive, and the assumption that humans disperse diffusively still prevails in models. Here we report on a solid and quantitative assessment of human travelling statistics by analysing the circulation of bank notes in the United States. Using a comprehensive data set of over a million individual displacements, we find that dispersal is anomalous in two ways. First, the distribution of travelling distances decays as a power law, indicating that trajectories of bank notes are reminiscent of scale-free random walks known as Levy flights. Second, the probability of remaining in a small, spatially confined region for a time T is dominated by algebraically long tails that attenuate the superdiffusive spread. We show that human travelling behaviour can be described mathematically on many spatiotemporal scales by a two-parameter continuous-time random walk model to a surprising accuracy, and conclude that human travel on geographical scales is an ambivalent and effectively superdiffusive process.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an approach to modeling land-cover change as a function of land-use change. We argue that, in order to model the link between socio-economic change and changes in forest cover in a region that is experiencing residential and recreational development and agricultural abandonment, land-use and land-cover change need to be represented as separate processes. Forest-cover change is represented here using two transition probabilities that were calculated from Landsat imagery and that, taken together, describe a Markov transition matrix between forest and non-forest over a 10-year period. Using a three-date land-use data set, compiled and interpreted from digitized parcel boundaries, and scanned aerial photography for 136 sites (c. 2500 ha) sampled from the Upper Midwest, {USA}, we test functional relationships between forest-cover transition probabilities, standardized to represent changes over a decade, and land-use conditions and changes within sample sites. Regression models indicated that about 60\% of the variation in the average forest-cover transition probabilities (i.e. from forest to non-forest and vice versa) can be predicted using three variables: amount of agricultural land use in a site; amount of developed land use; and the amount of area increasing in development. In further analysis, time lags were evaluated, showing that agricultural abandonment had a relatively strong time-lag effect but development did not. We demonstrate an approach to using forest-cover transition probabilities to develop spatially-constrained simulations of forest-cover change. Because the simulations are based on transition probabilities that are indexed to a particular time and place, the simulations are improved over previous applications of Markov transition models. This modeling approach can be used to predict forest-cover changes as a result of socio-economic change, by linking to models that predict land-use change on the basis of exogenous human-induced drivers.},

The method is based on the application of the Bayes rule for minimum error to the \&ldquo;compound\&rdquo; classification of pairs of multisource images acquired at two different dates. In particular, the fusion of multisource data is obtained by using multilayer perceptron neural networks for a nonparametric estimation of posterior class probabilities. The temporal correlation between images is taken into account by the prior joint probabilities of classes at the two dates. As a novel contribution of this paper, such joint probabilities are automatically estimated by applying a specific formulation of the expectation-maximization ({EM)} algorithm to the data to be classified. Experiments carried out on a multisource and multitemporal data set confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach},

In this paper, we introduce {METALAND}, a publicly available software tool and attendant database for the research community's use. In two applications, we illustrate how this framework can be employed (a) to establish a statistical regional context for a given landscape and (b) to assist sampling design and hypothesis generation at the regional scale.

	abstract = {Edge is an important landscape feature of fragmented forest landscapes in the Pacific Northwest, {USA.} Our primary objective of this study is to characterize the changes in microclimatic variables from recent clearcut edges into the old-growth Douglas-fir forests as influenced by edge exposures and local weather conditions. Microclimatic gradients are described along transects extending from recently clearcut edges 240 m into stands of old-growth Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France) forest west of the Cascade Range in the {U.S.} Pacific Northwest. Data for air temperature, soil temperature, relative humidity, short-wave radiation, and wind speed were collected over the course of the day from 16 different edges representing a range of edge orientations and local weather conditions over two growing seasons (1989-1990). Data for soil moisture were collected over three consecutive days in September 1990. Two indices, significance of edge influence ({SEI)} and depth of edge influence ({DEI)}, were used to evaluate the effects of edges on microclimatic variables. Edge effects typically extended 30 to {\textgreater} 240 m into the forest. From the edge into the forest, air temperatures decreased during the day and increased at night; the reversal produced mid-morning and late-afternoon periods when a gradient was absent. Changes in soil temperature from the edge into the forest were comparable to those for air temperature, except that edge effects did not extend as deeply into the forest. The gradient for relative humidity increased from the edge and was steepest in mid-afternoon. Humidity effects sometimes extended {\textgreater} 240 m into the forest. Short-wave radiation decreased rapidly with distance from the edge, reaching interior forest levels by 30-60 m. Wind speed decreased exponentially from the edge into the forest, depending on the relationship of edge orientation to wind direction; stronger winds influenced conditions deeper inside the forest, sometimes {\textgreater} 240 m from the edge. Edge orientation played a critical role for all variables; for air and soil temperature and humidity, it affected the times of day at which maximum and minimum values peaked. Influence of local weather conditions on gradients was highly variable. Overall, however, gradients generally were longest and steepest on partially clear, warm, dry days, at southwest-facing edges, and for air temperature, soil temperature, and relative humidity. {SEI} and {DEI} were found to be necessary measurements for evaluating edge effects on microclimatic variables, which responded differently depending on time of day, edge orientation, and local weather. No single value could be calculated for {DEI.} Because many ecological features near edges, such as tree stocking and regeneration, dispersal of flying insects, and decomposition of woody debris, seem related to microclimatic gradients, forest management to protect interior conditions should shift from the traditional charge (”create as much edge as possible”) to a new charge in which the amount of edge is reduced at both the stand and landscape levels.},

The number of different configurations in Life, a two-state, deterministic, voting-rule model with an eight-cell Moore neighborhood is 18. A similar model for the seven-state savanna system would have 21,021 different neighborhood configurations. For stochastic models, the number of possible state transitions is the number of neighborhood configurations times the number of possible cell states, A stochastic, unique neighbor model for the savanna system with a Moore neighborhood and seven possible states would have 282,475,249 possible neighborhood-based state transitions. Stochastic models with an eight-cell Moore neighborhood are probably most appropriate for ecological applications. The best options for minimizing the complexity of ecological models are using voting rather than unique neighbor transition rules, reducing the number of possible states, and implementing ecologically-based heuristics to simplify the transition rule table.},

	abstract = {Changes in vegetation due to drought-influenced herbivory may influence microclimate in ecosystems. In combination with studies of insect resistant and susceptible trees, we used long-term herbivore removal experiments with two herbivores of pinon (Pinus edulis Endelm.) to test the general hypothesis that herbivore alteration of plant architecture affects soil microclimate, a major driver of ecosystem-level processes. The pinon needle scale (Matsucoccus acalyptus, Herbert) attacks needles of juvenile trees causing them to develop an open crown. In contrast, the stem-boring moth (Dioryctria albovittella Hulst.) kills the terminal shoots of mature trees, causing the crown to develop a dense form. Our studies focused on how the microclimate effects of these architectural changes are likely to accumulate over time. Three patterns emerged: (i) scale herbivory reduced leaf area index ({LAI)} of susceptible trees by 39\%, whereas moths had no effect on {LAI;} (ii) scale herbivory increased soil moisture and temperature beneath susceptible trees by 35 and 26\%, respectively, whereas moths had no effect; and (iii) scale and moth herbivory decreased crown interception of precipitation by 51 and 29\%, respectively. From these results, we conclude: (1) the magnitude of scale effects on soil moisture and temperature is large, similar to global change scenarios, and sufficient to drive changes in ecosystem processes. (2) The larger sizes of moth-susceptible trees apparently buffered them from most microclimate effects of herbivory, despite marked changes in crown architecture. (3) The phenotypic expression of susceptibility or resistance to scale insects extends beyond plant-herbivore interactions to the physical environment.},

	abstract = {The {U.S.} Historical Climate Network is a subset of surface weather observation stations selected from the National Weather Service cooperative station network. The criteria used to select these stations do not sufficiently address station exposure characteristics. In addition, the current metadata available for cooperative network stations generally do not describe site exposure characteristics in sufficient detail. This paper focuses on site exposures with respect to air temperature measurements. A total of 57 stations were photographically surveyed in eastern Colorado, comparing existing exposures to the standards endorsed by the World Meteorological Organization. The exposures of most sites surveyed, including {U.S.} Historical Climate Network sites, were observed to fall short of these standards. This raises a critical question about the use of many Historical Climate Network sites in the development of long-term climate records and the detection of climate trends. Some of these sites clearly have poor exposures and therefore should be considered for removal from the Historical Climate Network. Candidate replacement sites do exist and should be considered for addition into the network to replace the removed sites. Documentation as performed for this study should be conducted worldwide in order to determine the extent of spatially nonrepresentative exposures and possible temperature {biases.ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}},

Worldwide changes to forests, farmlands, waterways, and air are being driven by the need to provide food, fiber, water, and shelter to more than six billion people. Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases. We face the challenge of managing trade-offs between immediate human needs and maintaining the capacity of the biosphere to provide goods and services in the long term.},

The basic statistic is derived, its properties are identified, and its advantages explained. Several of the G statistics make it possible to evaluate the spatial association of a variable within a specified distance of a single point. A comparison is made between a general G statistic and Moran's I for similar hypothetical and empirical conditions. The empirical work includes studies of sudden infant death syndrome by county in North Carolina and dwelling unit prices in metropolitan San Diego by zip-code districts. Results indicate that G statistics should be used in conjunction with I in order to identify characteristics of patterns not revealed by the I statistic alone and, specifically, the G(i) and G(i)* statistics enable us to detect local "pockets" of dependence that may not show up when using global statistics.},

Whole watershed land use in the 1950s was the best predictor of present-day diversity, whereas riparian land use and watershed land use in the 1990s were comparatively poor indicators. Our findings indicate that past land-use activity, particularly agriculture, may result in long-term modifications to and reductions in aquatic diversity, regardless of reforestation of riparian zones. Preservation of habitat fragments may not be sufficient to maintain natural diversity in streams, and maintenance of such biodiversity may require conservation of much or all of the watershed.},

We regard these as alternative and linked views of the data. We conclude that the most important single view of the data is the Map View: All other views must be cross-referred to this, and the software must encourage this. The view can be enriched by overlaying on other pertinent spatial information. We draw attention to the possibilities of one-many linking, and to the use of line-objects to link pairs of data points.

The problem is formulated in the framework of a two hypotheses detection problem. Optimal processors based on the likelihood ratio approach have been presented for two cases. The first considers direct processing of the projection data. The second applies optimal decision theory to the reconstructed data. Results based on computer simulation are presented in the form of receiver operating curves for different signal-to-noise ratios. Early results indicate that large performance gains can be achieved by direct optimal processing of the projection data compared with optimal processing of reconstructed data. Results for the latter case can be interpreted as providing an upper bound on all postreconstruction decision rules.

	abstract = {Different processes shaping land-use patterns are observed at different scales. In land-use modelling, scale can influence the measurement and quantitative description of land-use patterns and can therefore significantly impact the behaviour of model parameters that describe land-use change processes. We present results of a rigorous sensitivity analysis of a cellular urban land-use-change model, {SLEUTH}, testing its performance in response to varying cell resolutions. Specifically, we examine the behaviour of each type of urban growth rule across different cell sizes, and explore the model's ability to capture growth rates and patterns across scales. Our findings suggest that {SLEUTH's} sensitivity to scale extend beyond issues of calibration. While the model was able to capture the rate of growth reliably across all cell sizes, differences in its ability to simulate growth patterns across scales were substantial. We also observed significant differences in the sensitivity of the growth rules across cell sizes, indicating that {SLEUTH} may perform better at certain cell sizes than at others. These findings emphasize the importance of scale considerations in land-use-change modelling research, particularly in terms of determining the relevant and appropriate scales of enquiry for the processes being simulated.},

	volume = {61},
	abstract = {Modern ecological research often involves the comparison of the usage of habitat types or food items to the availability of those resources to the animal. Widely used methods of determining preference from measurements of usage and availability depend critically on the array of components that the researcher, often with a degree of arbitrariness, deems available to the animal. This paper proposes a new method, based on ranks of components by usage and by availability. A virtue of the rank procedure is that it provides comparable results whether a questionable component is included or excluded from consideration. Statistical tests of significance are given for the method. The paper also offers a hierarchical ordering of selection processes. This hierarchy resolves certain inconsistencies among studies of selection and is compatible with the analytic technique offered in this paper.},

Cases reviewed support the conclusion that neither population nor poverty alone constitute the sole and major underlying causes of land-cover change worldwide. Rather, peoples' responses to economic opportunities, as mediated by institutional factors, drive land-cover changes. Opportunities and constraints for new land uses are created by local as well as national markets and policies.

The authors adopt a distributed modeling architecture ({DMA)} in {MABEL} to separate the modeling of agent behaviors in Bayesian belief networks from task-specific simulation scenarios. Through a client-server infrastructure, {MABEL} provides an efficient and scalable decision request-response mechanism among heterogeneous agents, scenarios, and behavioral models.

The authors propose employing computer-assisted reasoning methods in conjunction with simulation models to create large ensembles of plausible future scenarios. This framework supports a robust adaptive planning ({RAP)} approach to reasoning under the conditions of complexity and deep uncertainty that normally defeat analytic approaches. The authors demonstrate, using the example of planning for long-term global sustainability, how {RAP} methods may offer greater insight into the vulnerabilities inherent in several types of surprises and enhance decision makers' ability to construct strategies that will mitigate or minimize the effects of surprise.},

Conventional {CA} models have problems in defining simulation parameter values, transition rules and model structures. In this paper, a three-layer neural network with multiple output neurons is designed to calculate conversion probabilities for competing multiple land uses. The model involves iterative looping of the neural network to simulate gradual land use conversion processes. Spatial variables are not deterministic because they are dynamically updated at the end of each loop. A {GIS} is used to obtain site attributes and training data, and to provide spatial functions for constructing the neural network. The parameter values for modelling are automatically generated by the training procedure of neural networks. The model has been successfully applied to the simulation of multiple land use changes in a fast growing area in southern China.},

Yet, in spite of our knowledge of their value, conservation buffers have not been fully embraced by landowners, or even by policy makers in the United States ({US).} In this critical review, we examine why conservation buffers remain underutilized in {US} agroecosystems. We examine the literature on the environmental benefits of buffers, the economic issues related to buffer adoption, and the importance of the aesthetic quality and design of buffers. We propose that many questions related to buffer design and management remain unanswered, and suggest a variety of areas in which future research is necessary to improve buffer functionality and adoption. The implications of this synthesis for designers, planners, scientists, policy makers, and citizens are discussed. Recommendations include: modifying policies to better reflect the preferences of landowners and society, studying buffer systems at the watershed scale using multidisciplinary approaches, and designing buffers that consider aesthetic preferences and regional variation.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT} Aim We explored the importance of climate and land cover in bird species distribution models on multiple spatial scales. In particular, we tested whether the integration of land cover data improves the performance of pure bioclimatic models. Location Finland, northern Europe. Methods The data of the bird atlas survey carried out in 1986-89 using a 10 x 10 km uniform grid system in Finland were employed in the analyses. Land cover and climatic variables were compiled using the same grid system. The dependent and explanatory variables were resampled to 20-km, 40-km and 80-km resolutions. Generalized additive models ({GAM)} were constructed for each of the 88 land bird species studied in order to estimate the probability of occurrence as a function of (1) climate and (2) climate and land cover variables. Model accuracy was measured by a cross-validation approach using the area under the curve ({AUC)} of a receiver operating characteristic ({ROC)} plot. Results In general, the accuracies of the 88 bird-climate models were good at all studied resolutions. However, the inclusion of land cover increased the performance of 79 and 78 of the 88 bioclimatic models at 10-km and 20-km resolutions, respectively. There was no significant improvement at the 40-km resolution. In contrast to the finer resolutions, the inclusion of land cover variables decreased the modelling accuracy at 80km resolution. Main conclusions Our results suggest that the determinants of bird species distributions are hierarchically structured: climatic variables are large-scale determinants, followed by land cover at finer resolutions. The majority of the land bird species in Finland are rather clearly correlated with climate, and bioclimate envelope models can provide useful tools for identifying the relationships between these species and the environment at resolutions ranging from 10 km to 80 km. However, the notable contribution of land cover to the accuracy of bioclimatic models at 10-20-km resolutions indicates that the integration of climate and land cover information can improve our understanding and model predictions of biogeographical patterns under global change.},

	volume = {39},
	abstract = {Conventional approaches to accuracy assessment for land cover maps produced from remote sensing use either confusion matrices or the Kappa statistic to quantify map quality. These approaches yield global or class-specific measures of map quality by comparing classification results with independent ground-truth data. In most maps, considerable spatial variation is present in the accuracy of land cover labels that is not captured by these statistics. To date, this issue has rarely been addressed in the land cover remote sensing literature. The authors present a method to estimate pixel-scale land cover classification confidence using nonparametric machine learning methods. The method is based on recent theoretical developments from the domains of statistics and machine learning that explain the machine learning technique known as \&ldquo;boosting\&rdquo; as being equivalent to additive logistic regression. As a result, results from classification algorithms that use boosting can be assigned classification confidences based on probability estimates assigned to them using this theory. they test this approach using three different data sets. Their results demonstrate that classification errors tend to have low classification confidence while correctly classified pixels tend to have higher confidence. Thus, the method described in this paper may be used as a basis for providing spatially explicit maps of classification quality. This type of information will provide substantial additional information regarding map quality relative to more conventional quality measures and should be useful to end-users of map products derived from remote sensing},

In this paper, we describe a `conceptual template' that can be used to catalyse this process. The template comprises (a) a list of high-level concepts that capture the essential aspects of any significant human-environment problem, plus (b) broad lists of low-level basic concepts drawn from a range of disciplines. Our high-level concepts, which we call `conceptual clusters', are labelled Dynamics \& System, Organisation \& Scale, Controlling Models, Management \& Policy, Adaptation \& Learning, and History. Many of the clustered, lower-level concepts are synonyms and thus provide possible connections between disciplines–for this reason we call them `nexus concepts'. We suggest that a conceptual template like that presented here can provide strong support to the initial phases of integrative research programs.},

In particular nonbinary weights are allowed and the statistics are related to Moran's autocorrelation statistic, I. The correlations between nearby values of the statistics are derived and verified by simulation. A Bonferroni criterion is used to approximate signifiance levels when testing extreme values from the set of statistics. An example of the use of the statistics is given using spatial-temporal data on-the {AIDS} epidemic centering on San Francisco. Results indicate that in recent years the disease is intensifying in the counties surrounding the city.},

They argued that if last-hatched nestlings die as a consequence of hatching asynchrony, then brood reduction must be maladaptive. I construct a model similar to a model by D. M. Temme and E. Charnov. In my model, asynchronously hatched broods experience reduced survival rates of the last-hatched nestling during good food years, and synchronously hatched broods experience entire brood starvation during bad food years. I compare the reproductive performance of parents raising an asynchronously hatched brood to parents raising a synchronously hatched brood. I show that hatching asynchrony is favored over synchronous hatching when good food years are not very frequent, when the survival rate of last-hatched nestlings during good food years is high, when the survival rate of nestlings raised in synchronously hatched broods during bad food years is low, or when bad food years are not severe. I discuss the model's assumptions and predictions, and I compare the results of this model to Temme and Charnov's model.},

A variety of social, political, and environmental factors contribute to the model's predictor variables of land use change. This paper presents a version of the {LTM} parameterized for Michigan's Grand Traverse Bay Watershed and explores how factors such as roads, highways, residential streets, rivers, Great Lakes coastlines, recreational facilities, inland lakes, agricultural density, and quality of views can influence urbanization patterns in this coastal watershed. {ANNs} are used to learn the patterns of development in the region and test the predictive capacity of the model, while {GIS} is used to develop the spatial, predictor drivers and perform spatial analysis on the results. The predictive ability of the model improved at larger scales when assessed using a moving scalable window metric. Finally, the individual contribution of each predictor variable was examined and shown to vary across spatial scales. At the smallest scales, quality views were the strongest predictor variable. We interpreted the multi-scale influences of land use change, illustrating the relative influences of site (e.g. quality of views, residential streets) and situation (e.g. highways and county roads) variables at different scales.},

Three different types of models were developed. First, we trained and tested the neural nets within each region and compared them against observed change. Second, we used the training weights from one area and applied them to the other. Third, we selected a small subset (similar to1\%) of the Twin Cities area where a lot of urban change occurred. Four model performance metrics are reported: (1) Kappa; (2) the scale which correct and paired omission/commission errors exceed 50\%; (3) landscape pattern metrics; and (4) percentage of cells in agreement between model simulations. We found that the neural net model in most cases performed well on pattern but not location using Kappa. The model performed well only in one case where the neural net weights from one area were used to simulate the other. We suggest that landscape metrics are good to judge model performance of land use change models but that Kappa might not be reliable for situations where a small percentage of urban areas change.},

	abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;This} paper applies methods of multiple resolution map comparison to quantify characteristics for 13 applications of 9 different popular peer-reviewed land change models. Each modeling application simulates change of land categories in raster maps from an initial time to a subsequent time. For each modeling application, the statistical methods compare: (1) a reference map of the initial time, (2) a reference map of the subsequent time, and (3) a prediction map of the subsequent time. The three possible two-map comparisons for each application characterize: (1) the dynamics of the landscape, (2) the behavior of the model, and (3) the accuracy of the prediction. The three-map comparison for each application specifies the amount of the predictionâs accuracy that is attributable to land persistence versus land change. Results show that the amount of error is larger than the amount of correctly predicted change for 12 of the 13 applications at the resolution of the raw data. The applications are summarized and compared using two statistics: the null resolution and the figure of merit. According to the figure of merit, the more accurate applications are the ones where the amount of observed net change in the reference maps is larger. This paper facilitates communication among land change modelers, because it illustrates the range of results for a variety of models using scientifically rigorous, generally applicable, and intellectually accessible statistical techniques.},

	abstract = {We define disturbance in stream ecosystems to be: any relatively discrete event in time that is characterized by a frequency, intensity, and severity outside a predictable range, and that disrupts ecosystem, community, or population structure and changes resources or the physical environment. Of the three major hypotheses relating disturbance to lotic community structure, the dynamic equilibrium hypothesis appears to be generally applicable, although specific studies support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and the equilibrium model. Differences in disturbance frequency between lentic and lotic systems may explain why biotic interactions are more apparent in lakes than in streams. Responses to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances vary regionally, as illustrated by examples from the mid-continent, Pacific northwest, and southeastern United States. Based on a generalized framework of climatic-biogeochemical characteristics, two features are considered to be most significant in choosing streams for comparative studies of disturbance: hydrologic regimes and comparable geomorphology. A method is described for quantifying predictability of the hydrologic regime based on long-term records of monthly maximum and minimum stream flows. Different channel forms (boulder and cobble, alluvial gravelbed, alluvial sandbed) have different responses to hydrologic disturbance from spates. A number of structural and functional components for comparing disturbance effects within regions and across biomes are presented. Experimental approaches to studying disturbance involve spatial-scale considerations, logistic difficulties, and ethical questions. General questions related to disturbance that could be addressed by stream ecologists are proposed.},

This paper reports a neutral model analysis of patterns in the absence of a structuring ecological process, to help set standards for comparing and interpreting patterns identified by mathematical morphology on real land-cover maps. We considered six structural classes (core, perforated, edge, connector, branch, and patch) on randomly generated binary (forest, non-forest) maps in which the percent occupancy (P) of forest varied from 1\% to 99\%. The maps were dominated by the patch class for low P, by the branch and connector classes for intermediate P, and by the edge, perforated, and core classes for high P. Two types of pattern phase changes were signaled by abrupt transitions among the six structural classes, at critical P thresholds that were indicated by increased variance among maps for the same P. A phase change from maps dominated by the patch class to maps dominated by the branch and connector classes was related to the existence of a percolating cluster of forest, and the P threshold varied depending on the co-existence of the core class. A second phase change from the edge class to the perforated class was related to the existence of a percolating cluster of non-core (including non-forest) and represents a change of context from exterior to interior. Our results appear to be the first demonstration of multiple phase changes controlling different aspects of landscape pattern on random neutral maps. Potential applications of the results are illustrated by an analysis of ten real forest maps.},

A multipoint self-balancing potentiometer monitors and records the output of the sensors in a prearranged sequence. Junction boxes and cabling arrangements are flexible enough to permit a wide choice in disposition and selection of sensors. The system functioned in the field during a 50-day period without interruption. Data obtained with the system illustrate the nature and magnitude of immediate climatic changes induced by the installation of a wind barrier in a field of growing dry beans. Comparisons of air and dew point temperatures measured on the site and at Weather Bureau installations 150 ft and 8 miles distant reveal great differences between the field and Weather Bureau observations and further illustrate the magnitude of error possible when basic temperature and humidity measurements from a remote location are used to derive secondary climatic parameters for a field plot or study area.},

	abstract = {Landscape management requires an understanding of the distribution of habitat patches in space and time. Regions of edge influence can form dominant components of both managed and naturally patchy ecosystems. However, the boundaries of these regions are spatially and temporally dynamic. Further, areas of edge influence can be defined by either biotic (e.g. overstory cover) vs. abiotic (e.g. microclimate) characteristics, or structural (e.g. vegetation height) vs. functional (e.g. decomposition rates) features. Edges defined by different characteristics are not always concordant; the degree of spatial concurrence varies with time. Thus, edge effects are difficult to generalize or quantify across a landscape. We examined temperature at eight times of the day across the edge between a clearing and a 50-year-old pine stand. We used simple, nonlinear equations to model and predict temperature gradients across this edge over time. The depth of edge influence ({DEI)} on temperature varied from 0 to 40 m, depending on the patch type and time of day. Two equations were required to model adequately (r2{\textgreater}0.50) patterns of temperature at all eight times of the day. Model fit was best at night (r2=0.97) and lowest in the afternoon (r2=0.50). Parameters for the models could be predicted from local, reference weather conditions. However, these linear relationships varied among parameters and with time of day (0.29r210\% for all day-time combinations. The models tended to underestimate {DEI} for both patch types, though edge depth was more accurately predicted in the closed-canopy stand than in the clearing. The difference between observed and predicted edge effects was highest at midday in the clearing and during the morning under closed canopy. The models predicted the location of peak temperature and the slope of temperature change (i.e. pattern of temperature variation) across the edge and the range of temperature better than actual values. We suggest that this approach may, therefore, be useful for characterizing edge dynamics if a wider range of local weather conditions could be monitored during initial data collection. The empirical evidence for temporal changes in position and intensity of abiotic edge effects emphasized the need to quantify these dynamics across time and space for sound planning at the landscape scale.},

	abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Human} land use of forested regions has intensified worldwide in recent decades, threatening long-term sustainability. Primary effects include conversion of land cover or reversion to an earlier stage of successional development. Both types of change can have cascading effects through ecosystems; however, the long-term effects where forests are allowed to regrow are poorly understood. We quantify the regional-scale consequences of a century of Euro-American land use in the northern {U.S.} Great Lakes region using a combination of historical Public Land Survey records and current forest inventory and land cover data. Our analysis shows a distinct and rapid trajectory of vegetation change toward historically unprecedented and simplified conditions. In addition to overall loss of forestland, current forests are marked by lower species diversity, functional diversity, and structural complexity compared to pre-Euro-American forests. Todayâs forest is marked by dominance of broadleaf deciduous speciesâall 55 ecoregions that comprise the region exhibit a lower relative dominance of conifers in comparison to the pre-Euro-American period. Aspen (Populus grandidentata and P. tremuloides) and maple (Acer saccharum and A. rubrum) species comprise the primary deciduous species that have replaced conifers. These changes reflect the cumulative effects of local forest alterations over the region and they affect future ecosystem conditions as well as the ecosystem services they provide.},

To explore these environmental consequences of urbanization, land use change was forecast, and long-term runoff and {NPS} pollution were assessed in the Muskegon River watershed, located on the eastern coast of Lake Michigan. A land use change model, {LTM}, and a web-based environmental impact model, L-{THIA}, were used in this study. The outcomes indicated the watershed would likely be subjected to impacts from urbanization on runoff and some types of {NPS} pollution. Urbanization will slightly or considerably increase runoff volume, depending on the development rate, slightly increase nutrient losses in runoff, but significantly increase losses of oil and grease and certain heavy metals in runoff. The spatial variation of urbanization and its impact were also evaluated at the subwatershed scale and showed subwatersheds along the coast of the lake and close to cities would have runoff and nitrogen impact. The results of this study have significant implications for urban planning and decision making in an effort to protect and remediate water and habitat quality of Muskegon Lake, which is one of Lake Michigan's Areas of Concern ({AOC)}, and the techniques described here can be used in other areas.},

One of the goals of smart growth is water resources protection, in particular minimizing the runoff impact of urbanization. To investigate the magnitude of the potential benefits of land use planning for water resources protection, possible runoff impacts of historical and projected urbanization were estimated for two watersheds in Indiana and Michigan using a long term hydrological impact analysis model. An optimization component allowed selection of land use change placements that minimize runoff increase. Optimizing land use change placement would have reduced runoff increase by as much as 4.9 percent from 1973 to 1997 in the Indiana study watershed. For nonsprawl and sprawl scenarios in the Michigan watershed for 1978 to 2040, optimizing land use change placement would have reduced runoff increase by 12.3 percent and 20.5 percent, respectively. The work presented here illustrates both an approach to assessing the magnitude of the impact of smart growth and the significant potential scale of smart growth in moderating runoff changes that result from urbanization.

	abstract = {This research developed multiple regression models relating land use to in-stream concentrations of total nitrogen ({TOTN)} and total phosphorus ({TOTP)} in eight, low-order watersheds on the coastal plain of South Carolina. The study area (4860 km2) included dominant land-use categories of agriculture, forest, urban, and wetland comprising the lower portion of the Lake Marion drainage. Land-use data were obtained from a pre-existing {GIS} database derived by classification of satellite images. The models partitioned land-use categories according to distance from stream channels using a series of buffer zones around each stream. Effects of point source contributions were removed from observed in-stream concentrations so that nonpoint source effects could be more clearly delineated. All models except two were significant at P {\textless} 0.05. The models for {TOTN} (r2 from 0.250.63) explained more variability of stream nutrient concentrations than those for {TOTP} (r2 from 0.160.39). Greater predictive strength for {TOTN} than {TOTP} likely reflects differing pathways from terrestrial to aquatic systems. Land close to the stream channel ({\textless}150 m) was better predictor of nutrient concentrations than land away from the channel ({\textgreater}150 m). Land-use change scenarios (converting forest and wetland to agriculture) support the conclusion that management of stream water quality will be most effective with emphasis on riparian and adjacent lands. Seasonal models were generally significant (P {\textless} 0.05) and demonstrate that the seasonal profile of stream nutrient concentrations is dependent on the mosaic of land uses in a specific subbasin.},

	abstract = {While ecologists involved in management or policy often are advised to learn to deal with uncertainty, there are a number of components of global environmental change of which we are certain–certain that they are going on, and certain that they are human-caused. Some of these are largely ecological changes, and all have important ecological consequences. Three of the well-documented global changes are: increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; alterations in the biogeochemistry of the global nitrogen cycle; and ongoing land use/land cover change. Human activity–now primarily fossil fuel combustion– has increased carbon dioxide concentrations from @?280 to 355 {@mL/L} since 1800; the increase is unique, at least in the past 160 000 yr, and several lines of evidence demonstrate unequivocally that it is human-caused. This increase is likely to have climatic consequences–and certainly it has direct effects on biota in all Earth's terrestrial ecosystems. The global nitrogen cycle has been altered by human activity to such an extent that more nitrogen is fixed annually by humanity (primarily for nitrogen fertilizer, also by legume crops and as a by product of fossil fuel combustion) than by all natural pathways combined. This added nitrogen alters the chemistry of the atmosphere and of aquatic ecosystems, contributes to eutrophiction of the biosphere, and has substantial regional effects on biological diversity in the most affected areas. Finally, human land use/land cover change has transformed one-their to one-half of Earth's ice-free surface. This in and of itself probably represents the most important component of global change now and will for some decades to come; it has profound effects on biological diversity on land and on ecosystems downwind and downstream of affected areas. Overall, any clear dichotomy between pristine ecosystems and human-altered areas that may have existed in the past has vanished, and ecological research should account for this reality. These three and other equally certain components of global environmental change are the primary causes of anticipated changes in climate, and of ongoing losses of biological diversity. They are caused in turn by the extraordinary growth in size and resource use of the human population. On a broad scale, there is little uncertainty about any of these components of change or their causes. However, much of the public believes the causes–even the existence–of global change to be uncertain and contentious topics. By speaking out effectively, we can help to shift the focus of public discussion towards what can and should be done about global environmental change.},

With the increasing availability of spatial observations from remote sensing and intensive field studies, the current methods for assessing the spatial component of model predictions need to advance. This paper emphasises the role that spatial field comparisons can play in model assessment. A review of the current methods used in hydrology, and other disciplines where spatial field comparisons are widely used, reveals some promising methods for quantitatively comparing spatial fields. These promising approaches–segmentation, importance maps, fuzzy comparison and multiscale comparison–are for local comparison of spatial fields. They address some of the weaknesses with the current approaches to spatial field comparison used in hydrological modelling and, in doing so, emulate some aspects of human visual comparison. The potential of these approaches for assessing spatial predictions and understanding model performance is illustrated with a simple example.},

	abstract = {(1) The historical development, i.e. changing species composition and the areal extent, of the vegetation of the High Plains region of Michigan is traced with the use of printed and manuscript materials and contemporary forest survey records. (2) The classic pre-settlement Great Lakes pine forest occupied the rolling upland areas and was conditioned to fires at 130-260 year intervals. Fires were much more frequent on the drier outwash sands of the jack pine plains and openings and almost non-existent on the moist hemlock-white pine-northern hardwoods forests of the uplands and the swamp conifer forests of the lowlands. (3) Selective logging of the white pine and later the hemlock and the better hardwoods converted the hemlock-white pine-northern hardwoods type to sugar maple. Waves of fires, following the logging in rapid succession, upset the natural equilibrium of the Great Lakes forest. The ignition of the remaining debris or the slash destroyed the remaining seed trees and the seedling pine in the mixed pine type. The result was a poorly stocked forest of oak sprouts and aspen suckers. Oak and aspen had formerly played a relatively subordinate role in the pre-settlement forest. (4) The cessation of fires in 1920-40 allowed the maturation of the oak, the aspen, and the jack pine and set the stage for the new pulp-oriented industrial forest of the 1950s.},

This erosion of diversity can be prevented over the short term if recruits are highly diverse as a result of preferential recruitment of rare species or, alternatively, if rare species survive preferentially, which increases diversity as the ages of the individuals increase. Here, we present census data from seven New and Old World tropical forest dynamics plots that all show the latter pattern. Within local areas, the trees that survived were as a group more diverse than those that were recruited or those that died. The larger (and therefore on average older) survivors were more diverse within local areas than the smaller survivors. When species were rare in a local area, they had a higher survival rate than when they were common, resulting in enrichment for rare species and increasing diversity with age and size class in these complex ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Despite the recognition of cellular automata ({CA)} as a flexible and powerful tool for urban growth simulation, the calibration of {CA} had been largely heuristic until recent efforts to incorporate multi-criteria evaluation and artificial neural network into rule definition. This study developed a stochastic {CA} model, which derives its initial probability of simulation from observed sequential land use data. Furthermore, this initial probability is updated dynamically through local rules based on the strength of neighbourhood development. Consequentially the integration of global (static) and local (dynamic) factors produces more realistic simulation results. The procedure of calibrated {CA} can be applied in other contexts with minimum modification. In this study we applied the procedure to simulate rural-urban land conversions in the city of Guangzhou, China. Moreover, the study suggests the need to examine the result of {CA} through spatial, tabular and structural validation.},

A time series of male moth contour maps with 7 density categories (0, 1-25, 26-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400 and {\textgreater}400 moths . trap(-1) . year(-1)) was created using the {GIS.} The statewide gypsy moth population expanded at an alarming rate of 6,053 km(2)/yr with the largest area infested being 128,164 km(2) (85\% of the state) in 1993. The population-weighted mean center staved in the Lower Peninsula, but a low density population was developing in the Upper Peninsula during the 9-yr period. Map analysis showed that the statewide population gradually increased from 1986 to 1990 and then became relatively stable thereafter. Both the highest weighted average density (191 moths.trap 1 . year(-1)) and the greatest coefficient of relative dispersion ( 307\%) occurred in 1990. Linear regression slopes between successive) ears were {\textgreater}1.0 before 1990 and {\textless}1.0 thereafter, indicating an increasing and then decreasing population density change. Regression results between successive years indicate that the previous years' population map is a good linear approximation for the following (r(2) {\textgreater}70\%). In the 9-yr study, 55\% of the population cells staved in the same density class in the following year. A general pattern of population density shifts was that increase prevailed over decrease. Research methodology, population distribution, temporal dynamics, and density shifts are discussed.},
